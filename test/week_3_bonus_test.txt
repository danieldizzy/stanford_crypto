week_3_bonus_test.txt

The bonus says to check a given file: 

the hex encoded for this video (https://class.coursera.org/crypto-
preview/lecture/download.mp4?lecture_id=28) is:

03c08f4ee0b576fe319338139c045c89c3e8e9409633bea29442e21425006ea8

I've verified that file, but it's too big to commit.

Using this file instead for integration/regression tests.

# Stanford Crypto course

Course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/

Repo for solutions, misc hacking, etc.  This is less about learning
existing Python libraries than it is to understand crypto concepts.

I code in Python only infrequently, and so if you see something that
could be done better, please open an issue or create a PR ...  Thank
you.
